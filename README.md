# Simple Postman Newman pipeline experiment.

This project shows a very basic example of a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to run a pre-configured collection of Postman tests.
The tests veryify behaviour of the very useful [Restful-Booker App](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) by Mark Winteringham and based upon a subset of the teachings
of Danny Dainton via his [All things Postman series](https://github.com/DannyDainton/All-Things-Postman)

It can be run locally via Docker Compose by running the following:

` docker-compose up --build `
